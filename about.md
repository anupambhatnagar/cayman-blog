Hi :)

It's Anupam here. I'm a Data Scientist at Unity Technologies in San Francisco working at the intersection of Mathematics, Machine Learning and AdTech. In my day job I build machine learning models for all things Ad Tech.

Prior to being a Data Scientist I was an Assistant Professor of Mathematics (tenure-track) at City University of New York (CUNY). I wrote my PhD under Lucien Szpiro at The Graduate Center (CUNY) and held postdoctoral positions at New York University and Brown University.
