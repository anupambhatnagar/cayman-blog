Hi :)

It's Anupam here. I'm a Data Scientist based in Silicon Valley, California, USA. 

Prior to being a Data Scientist I was an Assistant Professor of Mathematics (tenure-track) at City University of New York (CUNY). I wrote my PhD under Lucien Szpiro at The Graduate Center (CUNY) and held postdoctoral positions at New York University and Brown University.
